This is a draft of a tool that is intended to analyze statewide stormwater monitoring data reported to the California State Water Resources Control Board, and could potentially be used to target inspections of facilities that discharge stormwater. The application is available at: https://daltare.shinyapps.io/Stormwater_Enforcement_Tool/

Stormwater monitoring data used in this tool is from the [SMARTS](https://smarts.waterboards.ca.gov/smarts/faces/SwSmartsLogin.xhtml) "Industrial Ad Hoc Reports - Raw Data" file (access to this file requires a SMARTS user account; this data is NOT available from the "Public Access" section of SMARTS). To access the file, go to:
 `Data File Downloads` -> `Select Regional Board: State Board` (from dropdown menu) -> `Industrial Ad Hoc Reports - Raw Data`
